Shortify is a user-friendly URL shortener designed to make sharing long links easier and more efficient. It transforms lengthy URLs into concise, shareable ones with just a few clicks. In addition to shortening links, Shortify offers several key features to enhance the user experience.

One of the standout features is **QR code generation**. After a URL is shortened, Shortify automatically generates a QR code for the link, allowing users to easily share it with others via mobile devices. Additionally, users can create **custom aliases** for their links, making them more memorable and tailored to their needs.

The interface includes a **dark mode toggle**, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preference. Shortify also ensures a smooth and responsive design across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

The project integrates external APIs like **TinyURL** to handle the URL shortening process and **QuickChart** to generate QR codes. Built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, Shortify focuses on delivering a clean, efficient, and visually appealing user experience.

Future enhancements for the project include user authentication, advanced link analytics, and additional customization options, making Shortify a comprehensive tool for both personal and professional use.
